* My dotfiles
The config files are organized in emacs org files. They are tangled
and symlinked to the appropriate directories.

[[file:emacs-init.org::*tangle%20dotfiles][A hook]] tangles all files automatically on each save.
~emacs-init.org~ is special and not automatically tangled. The >100 src
blocks make tangling take several seconds and ~org-babel-load-file~ in
~init.el~ tangles the init org file on each emacs start anyway.

For now the symlinks need to be created by manually running the
appropriate src block in each configuration file.

* Window manager
I use [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][exwm]] and [[https://awesomewm.org/][awesome]] as my window managers. When doing a lot of
coding and similar stuff I tend to use exwm as I will spend most of my
time in emacs anyway.
